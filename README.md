# Java Road 2023

I decided to learn java by myself and this is a repository just to document the process.


## Run code

To run the Java code do:

```bash
  javac file_name.java
```
```bash
  java file_name.class
```


## About

This project is something personal and has no intention of being something public, I will leave the public repository just by choice, but this project is intended to become a source of personal research and nothing really professional.
